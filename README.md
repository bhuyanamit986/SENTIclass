# SENTIclass
# **Project Description**:

---

You have got a collection of 25 thousands movie reviews in reviews.txt file and positive/negative sentiment labels for the associated reviews in reviews.txt. Here you have to frame a problem that needs to give classify reviews on the basis of their sentiments. The task is to build a neural network and perform end to end preprocessing and training to get accurate results on the classification problem.
